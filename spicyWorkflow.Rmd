# Read in images

Our images are stored in the `images` folder within the `Data` folder. We can use `loadImages()` from the `cytomapper` package to load all of the tiff images in this folder into a `CytoImageList` object.


```{r}

pathToImages <- "Data/images"
images <- loadImages(pathToImages, "tiff")


```


# Load the clinical data

```{r}

clinical <- read.csv("Data/1-s2.0-S0092867421014860-mmc1.csv")
clinical <- clinical |>
  mutate(imageID = paste0("Point", PointNumber, "_pt", Patient_ID, "_", TMAD_Patient))

```
